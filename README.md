# Airborne

This project is a sandbox project attempting to bring numerical and scientific computing capabilities to life via the distributional power of the web. 

The project is generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev) and consist of two apps:

- [Angular](https://angular.io) Front-end exposing scientic computing results from the associated Python server.

- [Nest](https://nestjs.com) Back-end wrapping the Python server and serving the Angular front-end
  

#### Reactive Programming
RxJS and no manual subscriptions 

#### S.O.L.I.D
Front-end as SOLID as possible.

#### External Tool

- ApexChart (https://apexcharts.com/angular-chart-demos/) - a very promising charting library
- Moment.js
- Axios

#### Angular Specific
- Directives (attribute)
- Dependency Injection
- Performance

#### Typescript Specific
- Native class (Date) extensions
- Type extensions
- OOP

#### NX Specific
- Seperate libraries interface and type
- Continuous migration of components into shared libraries

#### Testing
- Will be added soon...

#### Mathematics and Computing 
- Application and wrapping of transform methods applies to time series 
- More applications and interactivity will be added
- All computations done on the Python server (see repo airbone-fft-python for implementation)

#### Security
Security aspects are important, but not the main focus of this sandbox project.
